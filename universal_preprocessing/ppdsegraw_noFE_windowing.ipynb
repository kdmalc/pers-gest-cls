    "1. Rectify the signal:\n",
    "   - Take the absolute value of the raw EMG to ensure all values are positive\n",
    "   - This is a standard EMG preprocessing step to reflect signal energy\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Apply temporal feature extraction (e.g., MAV or RMS):\n",
    "   - The signal is segmented into overlapping windows (e.g., 200ms windows with 50% overlap = 100ms step)\n",
    "   - Each window is reduced to a **single scalar per channel** using an aggregation function like MAV (mean absolute value) or RMS\n",
    "   - This turns a long sequence of raw EMG into a **low-resolution sequence of extracted features**, one per window\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Resample the feature sequence:\n",
    "   - After windowing, each gesture trial has a different number of windows (due to gesture duration)\n",
    "   - We use resampling (e.g., `scipy.signal.resample`) to interpolate this variable-length sequence to a fixed length (e.g., 64 time steps)\n",
    "   - This ensures all samples have the same shape `[64, num_channels]` and can be fed into CNN/LSTM models as batched input\n",
    "\n",
    "# Why this is necessary:\n",
    "- Without windowing + feature aggregation, rectifying alone would reduce each gesture to a single averaged vector (i.e., 1 sample per channel) — losing temporal structure\n",

    "- Resampling standardizes the **temporal resolution** across gestures with different durations\n",

    "- Input EMG data is already:\n",
